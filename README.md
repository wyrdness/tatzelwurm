## Overview

The Tatzelwurm is a cryptid creature from the Alpine regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Bavaria (southern Germany). Described as 2-6 feet long, the creature has a lizard-like serpentine body with distinctively **only two front legs and no hind legs**, giving it an unusual appearance.

Its head is often described as cat-like or feline, and it reportedly has the ability to hiss like a cat. According to historical accounts, the Tatzelwurm is aggressive when encountered and was claimed to have poisonous or venomous breath.

Reports of the Tatzelwurm date back to **1779**, with sporadic sightings continuing into the 20th century. The most famous evidence is a sketch made by a Swiss hunter in 1934 and a photograph from the same year, though the photograph is widely considered a hoax.

| 1779 | First documented sighting | Earliest recorded Tatzelwurm report |
| 1800s | Sporadic Alpine sightings | Continued reports from mountain communities |
| 1934 | Swiss hunter sketch and photograph | Most famous evidence; photograph disputed as hoax |
| Mid-1900s | Claimed skeleton discoveries | Several claimed skeletons reported, none verified |
| Late 1900s-present | Rare modern reports | Sightings become extremely rare |

## Notable Evidence

### 1934 Swiss Hunter Photograph ⭐

> **Date**: 1934
> **Location**: Swiss Alps
> **Witness**: Swiss hunter
> **Evidence**: Photograph and sketch

A Swiss hunter claimed to have encountered and photographed a Tatzelwurm in 1934. He produced:
- A photograph showing what appears to be a small lizard-like creature
- A sketch showing serpentine body with two front legs and cat-like head

**Credibility**: Low — The photograph is widely considered a hoax. The sketch, however, is consistent with traditional descriptions.

### Historical Alpine Sightings

> **Period**: 1779-1900s
> **Locations**: Swiss, Austrian, and Bavarian Alps
> **Witnesses**: Dozens (mountain dwellers, hunters, travelers)

Multiple reports over centuries describe encounters with a lizard-like creature with two front legs and no hind legs. Descriptions are fairly consistent:

- 2-6 feet long
- Cat-like head
- Aggressive behavior
- Hissing vocalization
- Some accounts claim poisonous breath

**Credibility**: Low to medium — Consistent descriptions across time and geography, but no physical evidence verified.

## Evidence Summary

| Type | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Photograph | 1934 Swiss photograph | Likely hoax |
| Sketch | 1934 hunter's drawing | Consistent with descriptions |
| Claimed skeletons | Several reported | None verified |
| Eyewitness accounts | Dozens over centuries | Uncorroborated |

### Skeptical Explanations

1. **Otter or marten misidentification**
   Misidentified otters or martens, especially when partially seen.

2. **Folklore and misidentification**
   Combination of lindworm folklore and misidentified known animals.

3. **Pure mythology**
   Entirely folkloric creature with no basis in real animal—lack of physical evidence, connection to dragon folklore, implausible morphology.
