## Disclaimer

This documentation represents compiled historical accounts, folklore, and cryptozoological research on the Tatzelwurm. The Tatzelwurm is primarily a historical cryptid with connections to European dragon folklore. No physical evidence has been scientifically verified.

The 1934 photograph is widely considered a hoax. Historical sightings remain uncorroborated and may represent misidentifications, folklore, or a combination of both.

For authoritative information on Alpine fauna, consult peer-reviewed zoological and herpetological research. For folklore context, consult European folklore scholars and Alpine cultural heritage organizations.

The Tatzelwurm is an important part of Alpine cultural heritage and European cryptozoological history.
