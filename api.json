      "full": "The Tatzelwurm is a cryptid creature from the Alpine regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Bavaria (southern Germany). Described as 2-6 feet long, the creature has a lizard-like serpentine body with distinctively **only two front legs and no hind legs**, giving it an unusual appearance. Its head is often described as cat-like or feline, and it reportedly has the ability to hiss like a cat. According to historical accounts, the Tatzelwurm is aggressive when encountered and was claimed to have poisonous or venomous breath. Reports of the Tatzelwurm date back to **1779**, with sporadic sightings continuing into the 20th century. The most famous evidence is a sketch made by a Swiss hunter in 1934 and a photograph from the same year, though the photograph is widely considered a hoax."
