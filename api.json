      "summary": "An Alpine cryptid described as a 2-6 foot long lizard-like creature with a cat-like head and only two front legs. Reported from caves and rocky areas in the Swiss, Austrian, and Bavarian Alps with sightings dating back to 1779.",
      "full": "The Tatzelwurm is a cryptid creature from the Alpine regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Bavaria (southern Germany). Described as 2-6 feet long, the creature has a lizard-like serpentine body with distinctively only two front legs and no hind legs, giving it an unusual appearance. Its head is often described as cat-like or feline, and it reportedly has the ability to hiss like a cat. According to historical accounts, the Tatzelwurm is aggressive when encountered and was claimed to have poisonous or venomous breath. The creature inhabits caves, rocky areas, and high-altitude Alpine environments. Reports of the Tatzelwurm date back to 1779, with sporadic sightings continuing into the 20th century. The most famous evidence is a sketch made by a Swiss hunter in 1934 and a photograph from the same year, though the photograph is widely considered a hoax. Some claimed skeletons and remains have been reported but none verified by science. Theories about the Tatzelwurm's identity range from it being a giant salamander species, an unknown lizard, misidentified otters or martens, or purely folklore connected to European dragon and lindworm traditions. Modern sighting reports are extremely rare, placing the Tatzelwurm primarily in the category of historical cryptids."
